## Project Overview

A web application that allows users to track the food that they consume and which provides a visualization of eating patterns and nutritional data.

### Key Features

- Ability to sign up with email address or Google account
- Input info for Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation then determine their daily target caloric intake though activity level
- A way to update user info weekly to calculate progress on user set weight goals

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

- Makes writing components easy
- Ease of component reuse
- Mature dependency, informational and community ecosystem

#### Styling

##### bootstrap

- Allowed quick prototyping
- Various pre-built components
- Mature ecosystem

##### reactstrap

- Controllable pre-built react components

##### normalize.css

- Normalize browser styles
- Increased style consistency across different browsers

##### styled-components

- Allowed us to create components with applied styles and reuse them throughout the app
- Allowed us to create extensible higher-order components to apply styling

#### State management and Routing

##### redux

- Allowed us to manage complexity of state by keeping data in a single store as data changed throughout the app
- Mature ecosystem, high adoption rate among react community

##### redux-thunk

- Allows us to write action creators that dispatch asynchronously or conditionally

##### redux-logger

- Makes redux actions traceable and improves debuggability

##### react-router 

- Allowed us to conditionally render componets based on the URL the user is visiting
- Improved UX as it allows the app to behave in the way most websites behave and the way most users expect, i.e. as if there was a folder structure to the application

### Front end deployed to Firebase

- `firebase-tools` used to set up Firebase hosting and auth

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/nutrition-tracker-be) built using:

##### Express

- point one
- point two
- point three

##### PostgreSQL

- point one
- point two
- point three

# APIs

## Authentication

We used Firebase Authentication for user authentication and account creation. We used the Email/Password capability and the Google Account login method as well.

Details on how Firebase Authentication works can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start).

## API Documentation

Our app's API's are documented in Postman collections [here](https://nutrijournal.postman.co/workspaces/3f11e883-1e39-496e-ac06-063bb81be931/collections).

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY - this is your Google Firebase key, which can be generated in the [Google Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID - in the Firebase dashboard
    * REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID - in the Firebase dashboard

# Testing

Testing was done with [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/en) and [`enzyme`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/), along with mutation tests using [`stryker`](https://stryker-mutator.io/). Jest and enzyme allowed us to create more dynamic tsts built around our redux framework. Stryker helped us increase the quality and depth of tests by substituting variable and functions with fake data, then checking if tests passed or failed with the substituted data.

# Installation Instructions

`$ yarn install`

## Other Scripts

`$ yarn start` - starts the production server

`$ yarn test` - runs Jest tests in watch mode
